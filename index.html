  <p>Bill G. Thompson, 86, of Breckenridge, died December 24, 2019, in Hendrick Hospice Care in Abilene, TX. Services will be held January 4, 2019 at 1pm in the Chapel of Memories with Michael Roach and Charles Kuhn officiating. </p>

    <p>Bill was born November 21, 1933, in Fort Smith, AR, to John B. Thompson and Merrill Inez Goff Thompson. The family eventually settled in Throckmorton, TX, where they purchased the local movie theater. His experiences running the projectors inspired his life-long love of movies and movie stars. His knowledge of film history was impressive and he enjoyed quizzing family and friends about movie trivia. He also loved attending the theatre and especially operas.</p>
    
    <p>Bill attended Texas Christian University on a music scholarship, and graduated with  a degree in English. After graduating from TCU, Bill earned a law degree from the University of Texas at Austin and moved to Breckenridge to practice law, first with Judge Harrell and later partnered with John Cook. Bill retired in 2002, but was always willing to offer legal advice to anyone who needed it. He was a long-time member of the Texas Bar Association and served in the Army Reserve. He was a talented piano player, and accompanied his children at solo band contests when they were in school.</p>
    
    <p>He met the love of his life when he moved into an apartment across the street from the Dunn family. Treon Dunn, who had known of him while she was at TCU, agreed to go out on a date with him and had a great time. They married on July 2, 1960, in the First Christian Church in Breckenridge.</p>
    
    <p>He was preceded in death by his parents, John B. and Merrill Inez Thompson.</p>
